This archive contains version 0.2.5 of the cppsim library
(last updated on 2013/06/20)

This is cppsim, a process oriented simulation library for the C++
programming language. cppsim provides the user with a set of basic
primitives which are roughly equivalent to those provided by the
SIMULATION class of the Simula language. cppsim defines a "process"
class which represents a simulation process. Moreover, facilities for
process scheduling and statistics collection are also provided. The
user may build more sophisticated simulation entities or
synchronization mechanisms on top of those provided.

See the file INSTALL for the installation instructions.
